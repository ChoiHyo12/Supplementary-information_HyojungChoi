# Supplementary-information_HyojungChoi

This repository provides Python modeling scripts, RDF and potential energy data supporting the manuscript:

"A Melting-Point Energy Window for Defect-Induced Energy Release in Copper Nanoparticles"

## Contents
- Python scripts for FCC Cu nanoparticle construction and point-defect modeling
- Radial distribution function (RDF) data at multiple temperatures
- Potential energy data used for binding energy and extra stored energy analyses

## Notes
- All molecular dynamics simulations were performed using the Cu/S/C/H ReaxFF force field developed by Yeon et al. (J. Phys.   Chem. B, 2018).
- All simulation details are described in the main manuscript and Supplementary Information.
